								</header>
								<p><img src="images/offa.jpg" width="160" height="188"  class="offa">  <p class="para">"Every Ahmadi Muslim must prove to the doubters and sceptics that God does exist and that He is a Living God and that islam is the final religion revealed by Him" - Mirza Masroor Ahmad (A.T.B.A) message to Ahmadi youths.</p> <p>The program which is themed <strong>"OBEDIENCE TO KHILAFAT"</strong> is meant to remind the youths the importance adhering to the rule of khilafat. The Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmmadiya, Nigeria (MKAN) 47th Annual National Youth Convention (IJTEMA) which was scheduled to be held at Offa, Kwara State, Nigeria has now been postponed due to the outbreak of corona virus which has indeed proved to be a pandemic. A key aspect of Ahmadi Muslim Youths responsibilities is to ensure effective and efficient youth's moral and spiritual development in this depraved society. A number of professionals, religious leaders, clergymen, government functionaries, youth leaders and several dignitaries will grace the convention. Among programmes lined up for the 3-days programme include Welfare Visitation of Prison Inmates, Free Health Care Delivery, Symposium, Voluntary Blood Donation, Educational Competitions, Sporting activities and so much more.

										<p>
											"Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We make journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our destination".                          <p class="quote"><strong><em>- Joseph B. Wirthlin</em></strong></p>

										<h3 class="mov">MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
										<p>
											"Nothing in the world can take the place of PERSISTENCE. TALENT will not; nothing is more common than unsuccesful men with talent. GENIUS will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. EDUCATION will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. PERSISTENCE and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race".
