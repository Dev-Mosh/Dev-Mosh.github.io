The program which is themed <strong>"OBEDIENCE TO KHILAFAT"</strong> is meant to remind the youths the importance of adhering to the rule of khilafat.

										<p>
											"Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We make a journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our destination".                          <p class="quote"><strong><em>- Joseph B. Wirthlin</em></strong></p>

										<h3 class="mov">MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
										<p>
											"Nothing in the world can take the place of PERSISTENCE. TALENT will not; nothing is more common than unsuccesful men with talent. GENIUS will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. EDUCATION will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. PERSISTENCE and DETERMINATION alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race".
